- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- API


## Project Setup

### First time setup

```sh

git clone https://github.com/Kritika30032002/Global_Weather.git

```

### Installation

Global_Weather has a single installation step:

- **Install the dependencies**:

```sh

npm install

```

You've now finished installing everything! Let's start :

Ps: if you're getting error installing the dependencies, try --force command along with npm install. For example

```sh

npm install --force

```

### Create a `.env` file in the root directory

- go to [weather api website](https://home.openweathermap.org/)
- create an account
- copy the weather apiKey
- paste this line in the .env file: `apiKey = "your apiKey"`

Now you're ready to run the app locally and sign into your local instance!

### Running the app locally

#### Start the servers

To Start the development server run

```sh
node app.js
```

Or if you have nodemon installed on your system , run
```sh
nodemon app.js
```

Open chrome and run
```sh
http://localhost:3000/
```

## How to get started with Open Source

Here's a quick run down on how to get started with open source, first of all let's know some basic terminologies:

- Git: is a versioning system that let's you store your code and code history on your local computer preventing loses and allowing sharing of that code
- Github: is a server that let's you store the history in a database
- Open Source: A project is said to be open sourced if you can see the code on GitHub
- Fork: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub, it gets added to your repositories
- Repository: A project on GitHub is called a repository
- Pull Request: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project, this consists of you editing a file in the project.
- Issue: An issue is a change that should be done in a project, can be a bug, a new feature or a suggestion to a project
- Branch: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace(main or master), it allows you to work on something without affecting the original code
- Star: When you star a repositiory, it gets saved to your profile and you can easily re-visit it.

Now you know some basic terms, let's get into how to get started with some resources to let you understand open source better:

## Contributing

**I heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards! :raised_hands:**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope‚Äîit's our entire product.

## Rules

- **No `console.log`s in any file**: We use the `debug` module across the codebase to log debugging information in development only. Never commit a file that contains a `console.log` as CI will fail your build. The only exceptions are errors, which you can log, but you have to use `console.error` to be explicit about it
- **Code reviews**: All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.



### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on Global_Weather or have ideas for features we should implement, the issue tracker is the best place to share your ideas.  ([click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/Kritika30032002/Global_Weather/issues))

### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

- If you find a bug on Project and open a PR that fixes it we'll review it as soon as possible to ensure it matches our engineering standards.
- If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss what it'd look like .
- If you want to contribute but are unsure to start, we have [a "good first issue" label](https://github.com/Kritika30032002/Global_Weather/contribute) which is applied to newcomer-friendly issues and pick something you like!
- Want to fix a bug or implement an agreed-upon feature? Great, jump to the [local setup instructions](#first-time-setup)!
